    <p>Hey! My name is Molly! I'm originally from Portland, Oregon and moved to Houston to attend Rice University. I graduated in 2014 with a degree in Materials Science and Engineering. In my free time I like to do yoga, explore the Houston craft beer scene, travel, and spend time with my friends and family. I have a kitty name Tyga and a yorkie named Moose who also get a lot of my attention.</p>
